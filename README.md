# Splendor_for_visitors

Here is the whole java project which is supposed to be an adaptation of the famous game called "Splendor".
It has been done in colloboration with one of my classmate called Dylan DejesusMilitar.
He's a great developer and he worked on most part of the project. 
I'm the one who worked on my own and entirely on the AI and I've corrected a part of his job.

You can find all the files that have been created by Us here.
You can also find a zip which contains the whole project with the respect of the tree form.
There's also a ".jar" file which is a fast way of playing the game. You can find it into the zip file.

You can do a party in a graphic mode or a console mode.
You just have to follow what is explained in the user manual in order to play correctly a party.
